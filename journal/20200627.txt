Today I want to hook ProcessEvent and try to print out all the unique events
that'll go through the hook.

I first need to find a signature for the ProcessEvent function. Finding this
signature should be easy because I already have comments set up in x32dbg at the
function prologue of ProcessEvent. I'm going to first look for places where the
address of ProcessEvent is hardcoded into the .text section or stored in a
global variable, where the former is how I pattern search for global names and
global objects. If I can't find a pointer to ProcessEvent through those two
searches, I'll try to construct a unique signature from the ProcessEvent
implementation itself.
